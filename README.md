Deep CNN Image Classification 🖼️🔍
Overview
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to accurately classify objects into different categories.

Features
✅ Preprocessing and augmentation of image data
✅ Implementation of a deep CNN architecture
✅ Training and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras
✅ Real-time image prediction using a trained model
✅ Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curves

Technologies Used
Python 🐍
TensorFlow/Keras 🧠
OpenCV 📷
NumPy & Pandas 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📉
Dataset
The model is trained on Sad and Happy image Dataset, which contains Two image categories. Images are preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
